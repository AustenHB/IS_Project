            <h1>Summary</h1>
            <p>
                Driven by a results-focused approach, I leveraged data analytics and interpersonal skills at Burnley
                Football Club to enhance partner relations and increase sales leads. As a Soccer Coach at Graham Stack
                Soccer Academy, I fostered team potential and player growth, demonstrating exceptional multitasking and
                collaboration. I am an organized and dependable candidate successful at managing multiple priorities
                with a positive attitude. I have the willingness to take on added responsibilities to meet team goals.
